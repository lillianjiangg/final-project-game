# Lillian Jiang - Intro to Programming Final Project - Fall 2019

## Description  
Color Shapes is a therapeutic game in which you are able to color shapes by clicking your mouse. When the game first starts, there are blank shapes outlined in colors. By clicking the mouse in each shape you are able to color the shape with the color that it is on the outline. After you have finished coloring all the shapes, you will see that you have colored shapes that look retro! 

## Directions
1. Press run
2. Click on the shapes to color them in
3. Click on the reset button to reset the colors of the shapes to blank and start the game over again!
