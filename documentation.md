## Color Shapes
Color Shapes is a therapeutic game in which you are able to color shapes by clicking your mouse in the shape. When the game first starts, there are blank shapes outlined in colors. By clicking the mouse in each shape you are able to color the shape with the color that it is on the outline. After you have finished coloring all the shapes, you will see that you have colored shapes that look retro and the background will turn a salmon color.

### Directions
1. Press run
2. Click on the shapes to color them in
3. Click on the reset button to reset the colors of the shapes to blank and start the game over again! 


### Website

I will go over how to set this up, but I promise it's simple! You will create a GitHub Pages site containing:

* More detailed description of your game
* Citations of your sources
* Flowchart (or link to it)
* Presentation (or link to it)
* Anything else you think may be relevant, such as directions for playing your game

Please note that this may be a single page, but can be split into multiple pages for better organization. The goal is to make it easy to find all the relevant information about your project in one place.

### Flowchart

* May be created digitally or by hand
* Should depict how the code runs
* If you need help, see me
* Please ensure that your flowchart is clear, easy to read, and does not require any special permissions to access. I strongly recommend a `.jpg` or `.png` file if you are scanning a hand-drawn flowchart, or a `.pdf` file for a digital flowchart

### Presentation

* 3-4 minutes
* Please include:
    * Game demo
    * Your favorite feature/what you're most proud of
    * What you learned while doing this
* Your class will have an opportunity to ask questions
